unity-webapps-qml offers a QML component that depending on runtime
settings and configurations:

- allows one to inject the UbuntuTouch Javascript platform bindings,

- allows one to inject a restricted set of API bindings when running as a webapp
(see http://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/webapp/packaging-web-apps/),

- allows one to load local javscript snipets that are to be dynamically injected
in the webview as part of a webapp,

The QML component supports Oxide and QtWebkit as a web engine backend.

= Automated UI tests =

The unity-webapps-qml component uses autopilot (https://launchpad.net/autopilot) to test its
internal sub-componenets.
To run the tests, you will need to install python3-autopilot and libautopilot-qt.
Then do the following:

    $ cd tests/autopilot/
    $ autopilot3 run unity_webapps_qml

You can get a list of all available tests with the following command:

    $ autopilot3 list unity_webapps_qml
